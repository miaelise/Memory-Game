This is my submission for the Memory Game challenge.

I have three separate files, the HTML, CSS, and JS files,
plus this README file.

The JS file is organized as follows:

The global variables are declared first for game start.

The newGame() function is called, and the event listeners
are set up to listen for card clicks, as well as the replay
button.

If the total pairs number is met, the game is won. If the
number of moves is too great and the stars run out, the game
is lost.

Below the main functionality are the function definitions,
organized by game play, performance, timer, modal, and reset
functions.
